The court applies factors outlined in section 518.17, subdivision 1, which include considerations like each parent's relationship with the child, the child's needs, and the stability of each parent's home. Additionally, section 518.155 mandates that the court must have jurisdiction under chapter 518D for any orders affecting custody. The fact that parents are unmarried is not determinative in custody decisions.\n\n**References:**\n1.

    "response": "To initiate an eviction action in Minnesota, the following requirements apply:\n\n1. **Complaint Filing**: The complainant must file a complaint with the court, stating the full name and date of birth of the person against whom the complaint is made if known, a description of the premises, the facts authorizing the recovery of possession, and asking for recovery. The lack of a full name and date of birth does not invalidate the complaint.\n\n2. **Written Notice for Nonpayment of Rent**: Before filing an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, the landlord must provide written notice to the tenant. The notice must include:\n   - Total amount due.\n   - Specific accounting of amounts for unpaid rent, late fees, and other charges.\n   - Name and address of the person authorized to receive rent and fees.\n   - Information about the tenant’s right to seek legal help and apply for financial assistance.\n   - A statement indicating the landlord can file for eviction if the tenant does not pay the total amount due or vacate within 14 days.\n\n3. **Service of Notice**: The notice must be delivered personally or by first-class mail to the tenant at the leased premises address.\n\nFailure to comply with notice requirements may result in the court dismissing the eviction action without prejudice and granting an expungement of the eviction case court file.\n\n4. **Expedited Hearings**: In cases involving behavior endangering others or significant property damage, an expedited hearing may be scheduled. Specific facts must support the need for such a hearing.\n\n5. **Summons**: Summons in eviction actions shall be issued with an appearance date not less than seven nor more than 14 days from the issuance date. Expedited hearings, however, may have different timeframes.\n\nIf these requirements are not met, the court has the authority to dismiss the eviction action and expunge the records.\n\n**References:**\n1.

    "response": "Minnesota's workers' compensation laws ensure the quick and efficient delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured workers at a reasonable cost to employers. Key points include:\n\n1. **Coverage and Compliance**: Employers must have workers' compensation insurance and provide evidence of compliance to receive business licenses or permits. Non-compliance may result in penalties.\n\n2. **Liability**: Employers are liable to pay compensation for work-related injuries or deaths regardless of negligence. Exceptions include injuries intentionally self-inflicted or caused by employee intoxication.\n\n3. **Notice Requirement**: Employers must conspicuously post notices about workers' compensation rights and obligations, with penalties for non-compliance.\n\n4. **Determination of Benefits**: Benefits are decided on their merits, not favoring either party. Compensation includes temporary total, temporary partial, permanent total, and permanent partial disability benefits.\n\n5. **Compensation Payment**: Payments should be made at intervals that coincide with wage periods, except for permanent partial disability, which may have specific intervals.\n\n6. **Disability and Additional Benefits**: Disability ratings are based on objective medical evidence, and additional benefits may be provided from accumulated sick leave, vacation, or overtime credits, but not exceeding the weekly wage.\n\n7. **Voluntary Programs**: Injuries from voluntary recreational programs do not qualify for compensation unless participation was required by the employer.\n\nFor more precise details, the relevant statutes include sections 60A.352, 176.001, 176.021, 176.139, and 176.182.\n\n**References:**\n1.

    "response": "In Minnesota, child support rules are governed by specific statutes:\n\n1. **Ability to Pay** - A child support order should not exceed the obligor's ability to pay. The court calculates income available for support by subtracting a self-support reserve from the obligor's income, and adjustments are made based on specific guidelines (518A.42).\n\n2. **Minimum Support Amounts** - There are set minimum support amounts based on the number of children, ranging from $50 per month for one child to $100 for six or more children. Certain exceptions apply, such as incarceration or receiving certain public assistance (518A.42).\n\n3. **Potential Income** - If a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support may be based on potential income, considering the parent's qualifications and job opportunities (518A.32).\n\n4. **Seasonal Income** - For obligors with seasonal income, the court may establish monthly payments that reflect income variations (518A.38).\n\n5. **Tax Dependency Exemptions** - The court can allocate income tax dependency exemptions and consider factors like financial resources and tax benefits for determining the allocation (518A.38).\n\n6. **Modification of Support** - Support can be modified if there are significant changes in circumstances, such as job loss or pay reduction. However, modifications only take effect when ordered by the court (518.68).\n\nThese rules ensure that child support is fair, reflecting both the needs of the child and the financial ability of the parents.\n\n**References:**\n1.

Social Security or veterans' benefits affecting the support must also be considered.\n\nReferences:\n- 518A.34 COMPUTATION OF CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS.\n\n**References:**\n1.

However, there are exceptions:\n\n1. **Sale of a Business**: A non-compete is valid if agreed upon during the sale of a business, where the parties may agree on a temporary and geographically restricted covenant not to compete.\n\n2. **Dissolution of a Business**: A non-compete is valid if agreed upon in anticipation of a business dissolution, where parties can agree not to carry on a similar business in a specific area.\n\nNon-compete agreements do not include nondisclosure agreements or nonsolicitation agreements. Additionally, any provision requiring adjudication outside Minnesota or depriving the employee of Minnesota law's substantive protections is voidable by the employee.

These practices are deemed unfair, fraudulent, and injurious to consumers and workers (325D.09).\n\n3. **Legal Remedies and Enforcement**: Consumers injured by certain fraudulent practices can initiate civil actions for damages, costs, and attorney fees. The Attorney General or county attorneys can seek injunctions against violations (325F.70).\n\n4. **Commerce Fraud Bureau**: This bureau investigates and prosecutes insurance-related and financial crimes, working with local law enforcement as needed (45.0135).\n\nThese statutes collectively help safeguard consumers from fraud and ensure avenues for education and legal recourse are available.\n\n**References:**\n1.
